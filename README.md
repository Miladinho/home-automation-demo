# Home Automation System

## TL;DR ðŸ˜…

1. Run `./runDemoApp`
2. Visit `localhost:8000` on your internet browser
3. View logs at `app/home.log`
4. View live changes to home data in `app/data/data.json`
5. Run `ctrl-C` to exit script (cleans up processes started in background i.e. app/api.py)

## Dependencies
* Nodejs version `12` (but version 8+ will probably work too)
* Python version `3.7`

# Description
The core home automation application is in the `/app` directory with the main file being `app/home.py`. The webserver (`app/api.py`) for the demo project is also in this directory since it is written in Python using Flask and using the same virtual environment. I am very new to developing large scale applications with Python and struggled a bit to understand module importing so to keep things simple when importing the main app into the api file, I decided to keep the `api.py` file in the `app/` folder.

### A word on testing:
The focus of a production ready application is the contents of the `/app` folder minus `api.py`, therefore, the only tests (`app/tests`) focus specifically on the business logic of the core software as defined by the specification. With more time I would have liked to add tests for the api, for the front-end network calling/data handling functions and end-to-end tests for the demo project using Cucumber.

## Core Application

### Architecture

The project is relatively simple in that it is a set of endpoints/methods defined by the specifications which use a data access abstraction (Repository Pattern) to read and write Light adn Thermostat values, and to add or remove Lights. The only domain objects are the Light and the Thermostat, but it would be relatively easy to add other components/devices so long as they have a "type" and "name" defined. The application relies on duck-typing.

The data repository `app/inMemoryRepository.py` itslef depends on a FileService abstraction because it performs file writes on each write operation to the in-memory data and it also reads in the initial state of the system from  a JSON file `app/data/data.json`

### Assumptions
* No home has more than 1 thermostat
* Thermostat component cannot be removed
* Components of type name "Light" and "Thermostat" exist

### System Constraints
* There is only 1 Thermostat component (see Assumtions section) and that object is already initialized in the system (via `app/data/data.json` file)
* All connected components/devices must have a unique name in the system
* JSON data file (`app/data/data.json`) needs tobe formatted with a "components" key whose value is a list of json objects (corresponding to unique components in the system such as lights and a thermostat)

## Demo Project
The demo project is a website and webserver that allows users to interact with the core home automation software. Ideally the entire demo project (webserver + front-end) would go in its own top-level folder like `demo-application/`but as mentioned before, the webserver (`api.py`) remains in the `app/` folder, but the front-end code does live in its own top-level folder `web/`. The frontend is written in plain Javascript using the React based Gatsby framework for static websites. Following the instructions from the `web/README` file, you can get everything up and running for the front-end. To use the front-end at this time you must serve the page with the development server. But the `web/public` folder contains all the static assets necessary to serve the front-end on any webserver such as nginx. I would have prefered to serve these files using the Flask api but again due to being a new Python developer I refrained from making the project more complicated lest I get stuck figuring out configuration problems for hours.

Concurrency is not supported on the webserver because it is assumed that the users of a home automation system are very few therefore heavy traffic is unlikely. With more time, I would have added websockets to the webserver in order for all connected clients to be notified of write changes to the system (ex. light turns on) but since the focus of the project was to build the core home automation software I refrained from making websocket notifications a priority.

Gatsby documentation suggests that you need the Gatsby-CLI running globally to work effectively but I've changed the `package.json` scripts to utilized the gatsby "executable" from the gatsby npm package in `node_modules`. This removes the extra step of having to install Gatsby-CLI as a global NPM package for none Nodejs users who want to get up and running fast.
